* About this file

Though =nix.org= is copied across all my Nix projects, not all of the projects
support MacOS. So this file has any snippets that reference Macs, which can then
be commented out as necessary.

* Mac installation

If you're on a recent release of MacOS, you will need an extra switch:

#+begin_src bash :eval no
sh <(curl -L https://nixos.org/nix/install) --daemon \
    --darwin-use-unencrypted-nix-store-volume
#+end_src
